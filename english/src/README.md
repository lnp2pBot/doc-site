6. If you don't find a suitable offer, create one and wait for someone to take it.
Type `/buy` in [@lnp2pBot](https://t.me/lnp2pbot) to [buy Sats](./how-do-i-create-a-buy-order.md) or `/sell` to [sell Sats](./how-do-i-create-a-sell-order.md), according to your preference, and it will guide you through the process.
